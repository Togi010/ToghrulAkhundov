            <p>On August 6, 2003, Birmingham, Alabama natives John Peinhardt 
            and Mike Mahon attended a Rotary Club of Birmingham meeting as a
            guest of John’s father, Brent Peinhardt. The Rotary Club’s guest
            speaker was the recently elected Alabama State Governor Bob Riley
            who was seeking support for his new tax plan. On that day, Rotary’s 
            large meeting hall was filled to capacity and the crowd listened intently 
            to their guest speaker. Following the Governor’s remarks, the floor was open
            for questions and for several minutes Birmingham Rotarians were able to question
            their Governor’s policies, voice opinions and concerns, and most importantly, receive 
            instant feedback. John and Mike were inspired by what they witnessed and were also 
            impressed by the large number of young people attending as guests. Having recently
            graduated college, they believed there should be an organization in Birmingham founded 
            on the same principles as Rotary but tailored to the needs and interests of young professionals.</p>
